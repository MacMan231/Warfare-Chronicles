## ⚔️ What is Warfare Chronicles?

**Warfare Chronicles** is a secure, AI-driven strategic analysis platform designed to support government and defense professionals in simulating military operations, visualizing threat landscapes, and applying historical doctrine to modern conflicts.

It enables users to engage with an AI interface trained on classical and contemporary military thought—featuring insights from figures like Sun Tzu, Eisenhower, Patton, Clausewitz, and MacArthur. The platform is built for interactive scenario planning, live threat assessment, and red/blue team simulation, combining historical logic with 21st-century digital warfare domains such as cyber, space, and asymmetric operations.

## 🧠 Historical + Modern Warfare Integration

Warfare Chronicles is unique in its hybrid use of:

- 🏛️ **Ancient Military Philosophy**: e.g., deception, maneuver warfare, and deterrence from Sun Tzu and Machiavelli
- ⚔️ **20th Century Battlefield Command**: e.g., aggressive tactics (Patton) vs. coalition strategy (Eisenhower)
- 🛰️ **Modern Domains of Conflict**: e.g., cyber offense/defense, hybrid warfare, information ops, and orbital warfare

Each scenario lets you simulate how these leaders might operate in today's warfare environments.
